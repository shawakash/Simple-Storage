            public : make the part visible or mutable internal contrats as well as public contracts;
            private : makes the part only acessceble internally ie not visible in derived contracts;
            internal : can be accessed only within the current contract or deeriving contracts;
            external : can be called by other contracts by message key or via transcation;
            Making something private or internal only prevents other contracts from reading or modifying the information, but it will still be visible to the whole world outside of the blockchain.
